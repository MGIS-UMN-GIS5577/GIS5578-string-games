#This game focuses on using strings in unusual ways
#Write a python script that will convert any given sentence and translate it to pig latin. 
#Pig latin is defined as taking the first letter of each word and putting it on the end of the word, then adding “ay”

#Hint: start with a word

userText = ("Please enter in a sentence so I can translate it to PigLatin: ")

    
#Can you get a collection of strings called "words"
for word in words:
    
    #Test your code 
    print("original word: %s piggy %s" % (word, piggyWord))
